She is not sure about her DEV dream, but she would like to use her programming skills for addressing urban problems or solving sustainable issues.

His prefered quote is: 

>_"Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didnâ€™t do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover."_ - Mark Twain
